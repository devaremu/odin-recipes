    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is one of the most common West African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (54.5g) oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion sliced</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp Tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Ginger Grated</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Blended pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Thyme</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Curry Powder</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Salt to taste</li>
        <li>White Pepper or black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp chicken bouillon powder or 3 cubes</li>
        <li>6 Cups (370g) Rice Long grain</li>
        <li>4 Cups (473.18g) chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 large tomato sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter at room temperature optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft.</li>
        <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper—about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, white pepper, and seasoning cubes. Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the rice into the sauce until it is well coated. Then add the chicken stock, stir, and cover with a tight-fitting lid, and then bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off the heat. Cover it immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little.</li>
        <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>
