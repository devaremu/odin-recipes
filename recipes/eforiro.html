    <p>The African Stewed Spinach also popularly known as Efo riro is a one-pot stew with layers of flavor. It requires quite a number of ingredients but little work from the cook putting it all together (as long as you already have all your ingredients prepped).</p>

        <li>Add the blended peppers and fry until the Sauce thickens up.</li>
        <li>Season with the stock cube, add Salt to taste, Crayfish and locust bean. Stir until everything is well blended.</li>
        <li>Add the Meat, Stockfish, and dried Prawns and add some water or stock to thin out the sauce, then cover it up again and allow it to come to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the Spinach and mix thoroughly. Then leave it to cook uncovered for about 2 to 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite swallow like be, Amala, Fufu or Rice, Yam ... Enjoy!</li>
